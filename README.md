# Hybrid_HDCS
Msc thesis project of Jochem Veerman on the hybrid knowledge-based/deep learning reduced order modelling of high dimensional chaotic systems as performed at the Aerospace Engineering department of the TU Delft

# Source code
The folders "Kolmogorov flow, Re = 20" and "Kolmogorov flow, Re = 34" provide the source code for the reduced order models for 2D Kolmogorov flow at a Reynolds number of 20 and 34. For each test, the knowledge-based, deep learning and hybrid reduced order models are provided together with the Bayesian optimisation routine to obtain the hyperparameters of the echo state network. Furhermore, in folder "Reference" the codes to generate the reference data are provided using the KolSol library in Python
